- Edward Tufte cognition and evidence-based design
	- how to make information clear
- user-centric design approaches
	- Who are our users?
	- What do they want?
	- How do they get the info?
- UX is primary and must come before any code is written
- UX must be consistent across all areas of a site
- judgement of good design can be had by how long it takes to understand what it is about
- Give a readable sign post for what the info is for
- obfuscation vs. simplicity
	- the worst designs are those that look like corporate reports
	- simplicity is always better
		- What is it?
			- a news item, product or download
		- where can i get it?
			- minimum number of clicks to get the content
		- why is this here?
			- remove if not helping the previous two
		- color: only use if you can think of a good reason
- bootstrap
	- great for keeping things simple and effective, working on all screens
	- but also possibly boring?

	- UX designs meant to trick the user
